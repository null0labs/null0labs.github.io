Whether you\u0026rsquo;re an enterprise splitting departments or a service provider managing distinct customers, VRF-Lite can streamline your architecture‚Äîwithout extra hardware overhead.\nToday, I‚Äôm showcasing a lab I designed that demonstrates how VRF-Lite achieves traffic isolation and address overlap in a Tiered ISP environment. This topology simulates two different customers using the same IP space, and yet, thanks to VRF-Lite, they remain entirely segregated.\nWhat is VRF-Lite? # VRF-Lite allows a single physical router to support multiple, isolated routing tables. Think of it like creating mini-routers inside one chassis‚Äîeach with its own interfaces, routing protocols, and forwarding decisions.\nCore Benefits: # Traffic Separation: Prevents cross-talk between customers. Address Overlap: Enables duplicate IP ranges across VRFs. Efficiency: Removes the need for dedicated routers per tenant. Lab Topology Overview # Lab Overview 2 customers with over lapping IP ranges\nThe diagram illustrates a provider edge (P1) router connected to two customer sites: CustA_1 and CustB_1, both using identical addressing schemes but operating in complete isolation via VRFs.\nColor Code: # üü¢ CUST-A (Green VRF) üü£ CUST-B (Purple VRF) Key Interconnects: # Gig0/0.1 (dot1Q 100) ‚Üí VRF CUST-A Gig0/0.2 (dot1Q 200) ‚Üí VRF CUST-B Gig0/1 ‚Üí Link to CustA_1 Gig0/2 ‚Üí Link to CustB_1\nBoth customers have routers using the same loopback subnet 192.168.10.0/24, showcasing that overlapping IPs are fully viable with VRF-Lite.\nUnder the Hood: Key Configuration Highlights # VRF Definition on P1 # ip vrf CUST-A ip vrf CUST-B\nSubinterfaces with Encapsulation \u0026amp; Routing # interface Gig0/0.1 encapsulation dot1Q 100 ip vrf forwarding CUST-A ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.252 ip ospf 1 area 0 interface Gig0/0.2 encapsulation dot1Q 200 ip vrf forwarding CUST-B ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.252 ip ospf 2 area 0 VRF-Scoped OSPF # router ospf 1 vrf CUST-A router ospf 2 vrf CUST-B With VRF-bound OSPF processes, each customer operates in their own logical routing domain‚Äîeven running the same protocols without collision.\nReal-World Implications # Using this technique, providers can easily deliver Layer 3 services to multiple customers with absolute isolation. Imagine an IXP or Tier 2 ISP who connects dozens of enterprises‚Äîeach running the same 192.168.X.X ranges internally. VRF-Lite is your safety net.\nValidation and Output # Wireshark Snapshot: Ping from CustA_1 Loopback to CustA_2g from CustA_1 Loopback to CustA_2 You see the traffic is isolated within VLAN 100 on the link between P1 and P2\nPing Output (CustA_1 ‚Üí CustA_2) CustA_1#ping 192.168.11.1 repeat 5 Type escape sequence to abort. Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 192.168.11.1, timeout is 2 seconds: !!!!! Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 2/2/2 ms Traceroute Snapshot (CustA_1 ‚Üí CustA_2) CustA_1#traceroute 192.168.11.1 Type escape sequence to abort. Tracing the route to 192.168.11.1 VRF info: (vrf in name/id, vrf out name/id) 1 10.10.10.1 1 msec 2 msec 1 msec 2 10.1.1.2 2 msec 2 msec 2 msec 3 10.10.20.2 3 msec 3 msec * Below showing the independent routing tables for CUST-A and CUST-B. Despite using overlapping address spaces, the P1 router handles each customer‚Äôs routes within their dedicated VRFs‚Äîensuring no crossover or leakage.\nDefault Routing Table (Global)\nP1#show ip route Empty VRF-Specific Routing Table: CUST-A P1#show ip route vrf CUST-A Routing Table: CUST-A \u0026lt;...routing codes...\u0026gt; 10.1.1.0/30 ‚Üí Connected via Gi0/0.1 192.168.10.1/32 ‚Üí Learned via OSPF from CustA_1 192.168.11.1/32 ‚Üí Learned from remote CustA site VRF-Specific Routing Table: CUST-B P1#show ip route vrf CUST-B Routing Table: CUST-B \u0026lt;...routing codes...\u0026gt; 10.1.1.0/30 ‚Üí Connected via Gi0/0.2 192.168.10.1/32 ‚Üí Learned via OSPF from CustB_1 192.168.11.1/32 ‚Üí Learned from remote CustB site Conclusion: the output confirms that traffic for each customer is strictly confined to their respective VRF routing tables, even though they both use the 192.168.10.0/32 and 192.168.11.0/32 spaces. Nice üòä\nFinal Thoughts # VRF-Lite may be ‚Äúlite‚Äù in name, but its impact on routing architectures is anything but. If you‚Äôre working on lab environments in EVE-NG or simulating a multi-customer ISP scenario, this is a vital tool in your kit. And best of all‚Äîit\u0026rsquo;s scalable, elegant, and battle-tested.\nWishing you a great week‚Äîkeep learning, keep engineering, and stay curious.stay curious.\n","date":"13 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/vrf-lite-routing/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Routing with VRF-Lite: A Lab Showcase","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"13 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/security/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Security","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/vrf-lite/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Vrf-Lite","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"13 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/wireshark/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wireshark","type":"tags"},{"content":" # Hi welcome to the first video on the channel where we wil start setting up and delivering dual homed internet service to our virtual customer in the lab.
