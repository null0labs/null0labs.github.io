This blog post showcases a lab simulation built around this topology, highlighting configuration examples, verification tests, and insights into why this design is foundational for modern data centers.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll explore:\nWhy leaf and spine is ideal for multi-tenant overlays Configuration snippets from the lab topology Ping and trace outputs between tenant workloads Mnemonic VNI/VLAN/VRF schemes that reinforce automation and clarity Lab Topology Overview # Our lab features:\nSpine Switches: SPINE1, SPINE2 Leaf Switches: LEAF1, LEAF2, LEAF3 Tenants: Tenant 1 VLANs: 10, 11 L2VNIs: 100010, 100011 L3VNI: 903966 Tenant 2 VLAN: 20 L2VNI: 100020 L3VNI: 903965 Servers: Vx-Server0x (distributed across leafs by VLAN) External Gateway: External-GW with internet access This setup allows isolated traffic per tenant with VXLAN encapsulation across the fabric, tested with L2 and L3 verification.\nWhy Leaf and Spine? # Leaf and spine is more than just symmetry—it’s scalability and determinism rolled into a modular fabric. Here\u0026rsquo;s why it shines in this context:\nPredictable Latency: Every leaf has an equal-cost path to every spine, avoiding bottlenecks. Efficient East-West Traffic: Ideal for VM-to-VM or container-to-container flows across racks. Horizontal Scalability: Need more ports or tenants? Add leaf switches without redesign. Overlay Ready: Perfect base for VXLAN EVPN, allowing tenant separation with route reflectors, control plane learning, and gateway integration. For labs like this one, it offers a rich playground to test tenant isolation and path validation—without compromising clarity or control.\nConfigurations # SPINE1 Configuration # hostname SPINE1 vdc

Whether you\u0026rsquo;re an enterprise splitting departments or a service provider managing distinct customers, VRF-Lite can streamline your architecture—without extra hardware overhead.\n# Today, I’m showcasing a lab I designed that demonstrates how VRF-Lite achieves traffic isolation and address overlap in a Tiered ISP environment. This topology simulates two different customers using the same IP space, and yet, thanks to VRF-Lite, they remain entirely segregated.\n# What is VRF-Lite? # VRF-Lite allows a single physical router to support multiple, isolated routing tables. Think of it like creating mini-routers inside one chassis—each with its own interfaces, routing protocols, and forwarding decisions.\nCore Benefits: # Traffic Separation: Prevents cross-talk between customers. Address Overlap: Enables duplicate IP ranges across VRFs. Efficiency: Removes the need for dedicated routers per tenant. Lab Topology Overview # Lab Overview 2 customers with over lapping IP ranges. The diagram illustrates a provider edge (P1) router connected to two customer sites: CustA_1 and CustB_1, both using identical addressing schemes but operating in complete isolation via VRFs.\nColor Code: # 🟢 CUST-A (Green VRF) 🟣 CUST-B (Purple VRF) Key Interconnects: # Gig0/0.1 (dot1Q 100) → VRF CUST-A Gig0/0.2 (dot1Q 200) → VRF CUST-B Gig0/1 → Link to CustA_1 Gig0/2 → Link to CustB_1 Both customers have routers using the same loopback subnet 192.168.10.0/24, showcasing that overlapping IPs are fully viable with VRF-Lite.\nUnder the Hood: Key Configuration Highlights # VRF Definition on P1 # ip vrf CUST-A ip vrf CUST-B Subinterfaces with Encapsulation \u0026amp; Routing # interface Gig0/0.1 encapsulation dot1Q 100 ip vrf forwarding CUST-A ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.252 ip ospf 1 area 0 interface Gig0/0.2 encapsulation dot1Q 200 ip vrf forwarding CUST-B ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.252 ip ospf 2 area 0 VRF-Scoped OSPF # router ospf 1 vrf CUST-A router ospf 2 vrf CUST-B With VRF-bound OSPF processes, each customer operates in their own logical routing domain—even running the same protocols without collision.\nReal-World Implications # Using this technique, providers can easily deliver Layer 3 services to multiple customers with absolute isolation. Imagine an IXP or Tier 2 ISP who connects dozens of enterprises—each running the same 192.168.X.X ranges internally. VRF-Lite is your safety net.\nValidation and Output # Wireshark Snapshot: Ping from CustA_1 Loopback to CustA_2g from CustA_1 Loopback to CustA_2 # You see the traffic is isolated within VLAN 100 on the link between P1 and P2\nPing Output (CustA_1 → CustA_2)\nCustA_1#ping 192.168.11.1 repeat 5 Type escape sequence to abort.

Despite using overlapping address spaces, the P1 router handles each customer’s routes within their dedicated VRFs—ensuring no crossover or leakage.\nDefault Routing Table (Global)\nP1#show ip route Empty VRF-Specific Routing Table: CUST-A\nP1#show ip route vrf CUST-A Routing Table: CUST-A\n\u0026lt;...routing codes...\u0026gt; 10.1.1.0/30 → Connected via Gi0/0.1 192.168.10.1/32 → Learned via OSPF from CustA_1 192.168.11.1/32 → Learned from remote CustA site VRF-Specific Routing Table: CUST-B\nP1#show ip route vrf CUST-B Routing Table: CUST-B\n\u0026lt;...routing codes...\u0026gt; 10.1.1.0/30 → Connected via Gi0/0.2 192.168.10.1/32 → Learned via OSPF from CustB_1 192.168.11.1/32 → Learned from remote CustB site Conclusion: the output confirms that traffic for each customer is strictly confined to their respective VRF routing tables, even though they both use the 192.168.10.0/32 and 192.168.11.0/32 spaces. Nice 😊\nFinal Thoughts # VRF-Lite may be “lite” in name, but its impact on routing architectures is anything but. If you’re working on lab environments in EVE-NG or simulating a multi-customer ISP scenario, this is a vital tool in your kit.

This time let’s pivot to a slightly different but powerful application: extending Layer 2 connectivity across routed infrastructure using XConnect over L2TPv3 secured with IPSec.\nWhy XConnect + L2TPv3? # XConnect, also known as pseudowire, enables us to extend an Ethernet segment (or even full 802.1Q trunk) transparently across an IP network. Combined with L2TPv3, which encapsulates Layer 2 frames in IP, and IPSec for encryption, we get:\nEnd-to-end encrypted Layer 2 connectivity Routing domain independence — works over any IP routed core Realistic lab environments — simulate MPLS/VPLS behaviour Use-case versatility — cross-site VLAN bridging, heartbeat links etc Example of a Xconnect setup between 2 sites layer2 extended across a public routed network to a second location over a single tunnel. Layer we will add a secondary path for redundancy. Why IPsec ? # Using IPSec allows the traffic to be secured before transmitting it over a public routed infrastucture. Here is a capture of traffic heading to the gateway we can see all the data. and after encapsulation we only see traffic between the tunnel endpoints and its encrypted.\nThis shows the original payload — including 802.1Q tags and full Layer 2 headers — untouched before encapsulation. Notice the transition to L2TPv3 inside IPSec (ESP) — payloads are now opaque, encrypted, and protected across the transit network. Adding a Secondary Tunnel for Redundancy # To improve resilience, we add a second tunnel path to build a redundant XConnect with failover. This protects the connection from WAN or router failure on either side.\nTunnel 1 to Site 1 via ISP 1 Tunnel 2 to Site 2 via ISP 2 Monitor the tunnels using SLA and routing metrics to failover the tunnel path Full configurations are listed below showing the SLA monitor used and the static route metric adjustments to handle failover with IPSec.\nThe same network but now with full redundancy. if the tunnel path via ISP1 goes down a tunnel path via ISP2 is used maintaining connectivity. Below is a before and after of the routing table of Site1 you see the path for the Xconnect is via tunnel 1 but when the SLA monitor sees the link fail the route is changed to use tunnel 2 and the xconnect stays up and passing traffic.\nBelow you see the xconnect endpoint 10.10.10.2 is reachable via tunnel 1\nSITE-1#show ip route Gateway of last resort is not set 10.0.0.0/32 is subnetted, 2 subnets C 10.10.10.1 is directly connected, Loopback100 S 10.10.10.2 is directly connected, Tunnel1 192.0.2.0/24 is variably subnetted, 3 subnets, 2 masks C 192.0.2.0/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet1 L 192.0.2.2/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet1 S 192.0.2.6/32 [1/0] via 192.0.2.1 198.51.100.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets S 198.51.100.2 [1/0] via 201.0.113.1 201.0.113.0/24 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks C 201.0.113.0/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet2 L 201.0.113.2/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet2 When the link to ISP 1 is broken\n%TRACK-6-STATE: 1 ip sla 1 reachability Up -\u0026gt; Down Now the endpoint is still reachable but via Tunnel 2 automatically\nSITE-1#show ip route Gateway of last resort is not set 10.0.0.0/32 is subnetted, 2 subnets C 10.10.10.1 is directly connected, Loopback100 S 10.10.10.2 is directly connected, Tunnel2 192.0.2.0/24 is variably subnetted, 3 subnets, 2 masks C 192.0.2.0/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet1 L 192.0.2.2/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet1 S 192.0.2.6/32 [1/0] via 192.0.2.1 198.51.100.0/32 is subnetted, 1 subnets S 198.51.100.2 [1/0] via 201.0.113.1 201.0.113.0/24 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks C 201.0.113.0/30 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet2 L 201.0.113.2/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet2 Testing Layer 2 Connectivity \u0026amp; VLAN Trunking # With the XConnect up, traffic from Server 1 in VLAN 100 can reach Server 2 on the far side, across what appears to be a direct Ethernet trunk — even though it’s transiting a routed, encrypted WAN core like MAGIC.\nBelow we can see server1 and server2 in VLAN 100 have reachability and only 1 hop away\nThe ARP table from server 1 only sees Server 2 in the table as its in the same broadcast domain The local switch Site1 has a trunk contigured on g1/0/1 and only VLAN 100,200,300 allowed\nThe ports connected to the servers are in the corospoding VLAN but as access ports\nASW-4-S1#show interfaces trunk Port Mode Encapsulation Status Native vlan Gi1/0/1 on 802.1q trunking 1 Port Vlans allowed on trunk Gi1/0/1 100,200,300 A Capture from Site 2 switch shows the traffic from Server 1 reaching server 2 and the correct VLAN 100 is visible\nPacket capture of traffic on remote switch after transiting tunnel This confirms that:\nLayer 2 continuity is intact VLAN tags are preserved No routing/NAT/firewall interference exists Device Configuration # Here are the complete configurations from site 1.

As a long-standing network engineer, the moment I saw City Fibre offering a selection of multiple ISPs delivered over a single GPON connection, my curiosity was immediately piqued.\nNaturally, I couldn’t resist diving under the hood to figure out how it works.\nThe Premise # CityFibre acts as a wholesale network, offering a broadband access layer to multiple ISPs via PPPoE and IPoE. You—the end user—choose your ISP during signup, and your connection is magically handed off to them, without changing physical infrastructure.\nBut as engineers know nothing is ever magic. It’s just a very clever design.\nMy Mission: Simulate CityFibre’s Model # So, I did what any self-respecting nerd would do: I recreated the architecture in a lab environment.\nI spun up a multi-ISP broadband network in EVE-NG with the following core components:\nVirtual Devices used Cisco C8000v Routers, Astria EOS Switches, Debian Linux with FreeRadius 3.0, Cisco IOL devices for PPPoE Clients.\nA CityFibre-style LAC handling PPPoE sessions. Multiple ISP LNS routers - (ZEN, VODA, GIGA). Per-ISP RADIUS servers for authentication. Full L2TP handoff between LAC and LNS, using dynamic AVP steering. A simulated OLT and multiple PPPoE clients, each mapped to a different ISP. A “Rest of Internet” node to simulate upstream connectivity with a test IP and allow the 3 test ISPs to reach each other. Network Overview, Keep in mind we are onlu focusig on the PPPoE Access layer Traffic Flows: End-to-End # PPPoE clients authenticate via the LAC to the City Radius Server. The RADIUS returns the L2TP tunnel attributes based on the user’s domain suffix. LAC builds an L2TP tunnel to the selected ISP’s LNS. The LNS performs its own RADIUS auth and assigns IPs, routes, etc. Traffic flows via the LNS out to the simulated “Internet.” LAC makes request for Tunnel AVP details to steer the user to the correct LNS LAC showing L2TP tunnels up and PPP forwarded to the LNS PPPoe Sessions on the LAC Deep Dives: Discoveries Along the Way # After many hours trawling through Cisco documentation and lab debugging, I uncovered a few golden nuggets:\nThe LAC makes a RADIUS Access-Request during the PPPoE phase. It expects the tunnel attributes (like the LNS address) to be returned from the RADIUS. By default, Cisco IOS uses a tunnel password of cisco unless explicitly configured. That one took longer than I’d like to admit! 🫣\nBut I pushed to get this working as I could easily steer the users to the correct LNS using statically configured vpdn groups but the more I thought about it that would not scale well and having to update every router vpdn groups even with a template would be painful.\nThe Radius Server debug displays the password ‘cisco’ even though it wasn\u0026rsquo;t configured anywhere, as noted in the Cisco documentation found at 2am.\nId 46 from 10.255.0.100:1645 to 192.1.1.2:1812 length 123 (1)User-Name = \u0026#34;zen.net\u0026#34; (1)User-Password = \u0026#34;cisco\u0026#34; 😡 (1) NAS-Port-Type = Virtual (1) NAS-Port = 0 (1) NAS-Port-Id = \u0026#34;0/0/4/911\u0026#34; (1) Cisco-AVPair = \u0026#34;client-mac-address=aabb.cc00.4000\u0026#34; (1) Service-Type = Outbound-User (1) NAS-IP-Address = 10.255.0.100 and there is was the password cisco is used just as a trigger Verifying the Build # Once everything was stitched together, I validated the setup by pinging between PPPoE clients and the simulated internet.\nI tested that all PPPoE clients can reach eachother and the test IP of 5.5.5.5 on the ROI node.\nZenPPPoE#ping 5.5.5.5 Type escape sequence to abort.

Lessons Learned # Even the most seamless consumer services are powered by beautiful complexity. It’s never just PPPoE and L2TP—especially when you’re steering at scale. Having the right tools and test harness (EVE-NG, Cisco IOSv, FreeRADIUS) is invaluable. (Might need to hit up David Mayberry at go-communications for some high quaility refurbished Cisco kit for a real lab test 😜) Keep pushing and testing you will find the bug Cisco docs and google will help you find answers\nKeen to hear from others building similar wholesale or carrier models. If you’re exploring PPPoE, LNS, or building your own BNG-like setup—drop a comment or message. I’d love to exchange notes! Especially the infamous \u0026ldquo;User-Password = cisco\u0026rdquo; mystery—this one’s a classic when dealing with LACs and RADIUS in a VPDN setup.\n","date":"6 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/cityfibre/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Virgin Media to CityFibre: A Network Engineer’s Curiosity Unleashed","type":"blog"},{"content":" 👨🏻‍💻 Engineer by day # Hey, I’m Matt—founder of Null0 Labs and a Senior Network Engineer with 20+ years logged on the command line, architecting, securing, and scaling high-availability infrastructure across enterprise-grade networks.
